This project focuses on the development of an advanced agricultural vehicle equipped with a pesticide spraying system for crop protection. The vehicle, powered by electric motors for eco-friendliness and efficiency, features a robust four-wheel design optimized for stability and mobility across various types of terrain commonly found in agricultural settings. Unlike traditional manual spraying methods, which can be labor-intensive and imprecise, this automated spraying vehicle offers a highly efficient and accurate solution for applying pesticides to crops.

The pesticide spraying system is designed to disperse chemical agents evenly and effectively over the fields, targeting pests and pathogens while minimizing environmental impact and reducing chemical waste. The vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated control system that enables precise calibration of spray rates and coverage patterns, ensuring optimal pesticide application while minimizing overspray and drift.

Leveraging advanced technologies such as GPS-based mapping and automatic navigation systems, the spraying vehicle can autonomously traverse the farm terrain according to predefined routes and spraying schedules. This automation not only enhances spraying efficiency but also reduces the need for manual labor, allowing farmers to allocate their resources more effectively and focus on other essential tasks.

By utilizing this innovative spraying vehicle, farmers can achieve better pest management outcomes, improve crop yields, and ultimately enhance the sustainability and profitability of their farming operations. Additionally, the precise and targeted application of pesticides helps minimize the environmental impact and ensures the safety of food products for consumers.
