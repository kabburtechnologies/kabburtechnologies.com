This system is designed to provide comprehensive security for homes. It employs several sensors, including Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensors and door sensors, strategically placed around the premises. 

When any unusual activity is detected, such as motion or unauthorized entry through doors or windows, the sensors trigger an alert mechanism. This alert is sent to the homeowner's mobile phone through a communication channel, typically via Wi-Fi or a cellular network. The homeowner can then receive real-time notifications and take appropriate action, such as contacting authorities or remotely monitoring the situation through connected cameras or other surveillance devices.
