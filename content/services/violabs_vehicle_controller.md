Violab's Vehicle Controller is a sophisticated control unit designed for vehicles, particularly those used in transportation or logistics. It incorporates various sensors, including temperature and humidity sensors, to monitor environmental conditions inside the vehicle. 

Additionally, the controller features components such as a stepper motor and RGB LED indicators for operational and diagnostic purposes. One of the key features of this controller is its ability to connect to the cloud using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. This connectivity enables seamless communication between the vehicle and cloud-based services, allowing for remote monitoring, data analysis, and control via MQTT messages. The controller's integration with the cloud enhances vehicle management, efficiency, and maintenance capabilities.
