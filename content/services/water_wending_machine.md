This project aims to address the need for convenient and accessible water dispensing in public areas.

The water vending machine is equipped with a QR code payment system, allowing users to make quick and secure transactions to access clean water. Users simply scan a QR code displayed on the vending machine using their smartphones, which initiates the payment process. Upon successful payment, the vending machine dispenses the desired quantity of water into the user's container, providing a hassle-free solution for obtaining potable water in public spaces such as parks, transportation hubs, or recreational areas.
