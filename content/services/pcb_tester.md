Developed specifically for Millennium Semiconductor Company, the PCB tester is a specialized device used for quality assurance and fault detection in printed circuit boards (PCBs).

The tester incorporates advanced features such as automatic touch switch activation and a camera-based vision system. When a PCB is placed on the tester, the automatic touch switches are activated to initiate the testing process. Simultaneously, the integrated camera captures high-resolution images of the PCB surface, which are analyzed using computer vision algorithms to identify any defects or anomalies. The tester provides rapid and accurate assessment of PCB quality, ensuring that only fully functional boards are deployed in manufacturing processes, thus optimizing production efficiency and minimizing defects.
